An Inventory management app for an imaginary store, with categories and items. The user goes to the home-page and can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. Users can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.

Destructive actions (like deleting and updating) are prevented by making users enter a secret admin password to confirm the action.
